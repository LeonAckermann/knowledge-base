# Brain inspired algorithms
Deep neural networks have been inspired by the brain on many levels. Convolutions firstly introduced by fukushima modeled the receptive fields in the visual cortex which makes computation learning of features more efficient. Other approaches are modeling [[Intuitive physics]] and [[Intuitive psychology]], [[Spiking Neural Networks]] and [[Neuromorphic Computing]]
