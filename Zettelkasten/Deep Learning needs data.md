# Deep Learning needs data
Since 2012 when AlexNet and ImageNet emerged, deep learning was the best known machine learning algorithm. The networks achieved a really good performance in the task of Image Classification. Back then, those networks were firstly possible, because of the amount of data available. Deep Networks are often trained in the fashion of unsupervised- or supervised learning and either way they need lots of data, to create an input- output mapping.
This is supported by the fact that deep learning system take a hit on performance if they is less data available
