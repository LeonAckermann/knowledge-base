# Shortcomings of Deep Neural Networks
However, Deep Neural Networks don't do well on many tasks compared to humans. Firstly, [[Deep Learning needs data]] to be trained to even achieve a comparable performance like humans, whereas [[Humans learn Core Concepts]] from sparse representations. Human can then flexibly use these contexts where as neural networks are determined for one specific tasks. This applies as much to supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.
Neural Networks don't have [[Intuitive physics]] and neither [[Intuitive psychology]] like humans do.
Moreover neural networks can be fooled and suffer from forgetting when they see new data.
There is more but I have to look for that.
