## General idea
[Representation geometry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RVPa5Ec9qsUlDNTbZ8QXAmWGwiL5ts1g/view?usp=share_link) (p.401)
1. a brain region's representaiton is a multidimensional space
2. the dimension of the space correspond to the number of neurons
3. a point in the space corresponds to an activity pattern of the neurons in regard to a stimulus
4. the dissimilarity of two patterns correspond to the distance between the two points in representational space

## Methods
### Classifier analysis
- didnt really understand

### [RSA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RkUvP-XMlb04996iN5q_sAToVvuwPrMU/view?usp=share_link)
- pattern information analysis to compare representational geometris between brain regions and stimulurs, descriptions, conceptual and computational models
- used when assesing if brain representation
	- reflects stimulus properties
	- reflects higher-level semantic properties
	- can be computationally modeles
	- relfects representation in other brain regions
	- is similar to representation in another species
- how do we do this? with a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM)
	1. choose a brain region and estimate activity patterns for certain stimuli
		1. activity pattern can be estimated with various methods which are not further discussed here
	2. put dissimilarities between all activity patterns in a matrix
		1. the dissimilarity is defined as the distance between two patterns
		2. we can use correlsation distance (1-Pearson correlation), euclidean distance, mahalanobis distance or cross-validated measures
	3. compare RDMs to another 
		1. with correlation between RDMs (rank correlation (Spearman))

## Representational geometry in visual system
representational geometry have brough insights to all stages of visual representation. studies of geometry of visual representations emphasize behaviorally important categories and semantic dimensions and deemphasizing accidental and behaviorally irrelevant variation of the visual input.
Here are some examples:
- clearer distinctions between early visual areas than single-cell selectivity measures
- representational geometry in V4 reflect perceptual color space and not in V1-V3![[Pasted image 20221121120347.png]]
- ventral-stream regions emphasize categorical boundaries and sematic dimensions of visual images in humans and monkeys![[Pasted image 20221121120304.png]]
- fusiform face area (FFA) emphasizes distinction between faces and non-faces and anterior temporal cortex discriminates individual faces![[Pasted image 20221121120153.png]]
