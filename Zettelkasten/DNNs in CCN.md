## Goal
- define mathematical models which explain 
	- neural measurements
	- adaptive behavior
- the better DNN performs on classification task, the better it performs on predicting neural data
- The explanatory merit of a model is not dependent on the exact replication of biological detail, but on its ability to provide insights into the inner workings of the brain at a given level of abstraction. 

### Similarities of DNN brain-inspired models to brain
- deep cascade of nonlinear computations
- receptive fields that increase in size, invariance and complexity
- passing of information through similar sequence of intermediate representations

### Dissimilarities of DNN brain-inspired models to brain
- difference of processing and recognizing visual stimuli
- performance weaknisses under image manipulation, reduced contrast or additive noise
- often don't include lateral or top-down connections [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363402954_The_neuroconnectionist_research_programme)(p.4)
- computation of continuous outputs [Source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363402954_The_neuroconnectionist_research_programme)(p.4)
