# Humans learn Core Concepts
The difference between how humans and Neural Network does not differ in different learning frameworks. It can be said that humans better and faster learn the core concepts of the data with less data. For supervised learning this applies in the way that humans e.g. can faster understand how a letter is written, and know how to write it, regonize it, or see if a line is missing. In the context of Reinforcement learning humans learn the core concept of a game in such a way that they are able to reach the goal in much less training time than neural networks. Moreover humans can alter the goal and still reach it while neural networks are set to solve one specific goal.
