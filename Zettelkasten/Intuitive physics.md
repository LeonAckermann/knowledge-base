This concept is about the capability of humans to act in the world and learn about objects in the world by perceiving how they act. E.g. 2 year old infancts learn about the rules that inanimate objects follow, e.g. they are solid, they don't move without external force... At 6 months babies can distinguish between rigid-, soft- and liquid bodies. They are approaches to make predictions about certain situations in the physical world with a deep net, which predicts how blocks will fall in a certain situation. It is an approach to encode information abou the physical world within the neural networks similar to humans
