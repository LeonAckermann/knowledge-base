# Always write in complete sentences
Writing in complete sentences is very important! When revisiting the thought, I want to be able to know immediately what I wrote down, so that I don't have to think about it a second time.

# Cut the words to show the essence of the thought
Secondly, I want to narrow down the idea in the least words as possible. Even though this will take more time when taking the notes, this system will ensure that I understood the topic for sure!

# Linking other thoughts
It is very important to link other thoughts to my new thought. Specifically, forward- and backward-links. This is how I can stay organized and the only reason why it is beneficial to use this method.
