# Deep Learning Revolution
What is the deep learning revolution? In 2012 mutliple breakthroughs were registered. Deep Learning algorithms were able to outperform different previous Machine Learning methods by a big margin. This was made possible by large amounts of data and a high computational power. The neural networks excelled at tasks like Speech Recognition or Object Recognition, major focus was on AlexNet which won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. Aftewards Neural Networks further decreased the error rate on known data sets like MNIST or CIFAR10. 
So in brief the Deep Learning revolution started with the incremental decrease of error rates on classifying existing datasets.
