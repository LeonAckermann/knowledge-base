- network architecture is determined -> inductive bias
- interconnected sets of units
- perceptual or cognitive computations are collective property of network

**There is multiple classes of architectures which defines general space of possible solutions**
- [[Convolutional Neural Networks]]
- [[Recurrent Neural Networks]]
- etc.

**They use different learning algorithms to adjust the weights of the network**
finding the matching learning rule is very hard because of the number of parameters. Learning rules have their own hyperparameters
- [[Backpropagation]]

**The objective function tells the ANN in what direction to change the output**
