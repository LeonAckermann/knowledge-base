**Goal**
- Neuroconnectionism is the approach to model behavioral data with sensory data as input and the philosophy of science of [[Lakatos' view]]
- explain cognitive functions 

It offers the framework to study which biological details are necessary for successful modelling

One main approach is to use [[DNNs in CCN]] and [[ANNs]]

Different ANN architectures offer possibilites to test hypothesis about how functions should be implemented
